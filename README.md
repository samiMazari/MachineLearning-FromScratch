|------|------------|
| **AI** | **Artificial Intelligence** – The broad science of making machines "intelligent" or capable of performing tasks that require human intelligence. |
| **ML** | **Machine Learning** – A subset of AI that focuses on training algorithms to learn patterns from data and make predictions or decisions. |
| **DL** | **Deep Learning** – A subfield of ML using neural networks with multiple layers to model complex patterns in data. |
| **Supervised Learning** | ML tasks where the model is trained on labeled data (input-output pairs). |
| **Unsupervised Learning** | ML tasks where the model identifies patterns in data without labeled outputs. |
| **Reinforcement Learning** | A type of ML where an agent learns to make decisions by performing actions in an environment to maximize cumulative reward. |
